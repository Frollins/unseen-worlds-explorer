#The Memento Emporium

(REDACTED), a cashier at the NoFrills herself walking into the Emporium after passing through the doors to the back area located at the back of the building. (I must mention that this is all "alleged" but we know the truth, fellow cryptid chasers!)
The source claims that "After entering the back, there was all these shelves. We got shelves, of course, but these were filled to the brim with knicks knacks and (expletive) - a LightBrite, some old lead fishing lures, and a framed photograph of the 80s Oilers dressed up as pirates. So uh... definitely not groceries.  Thought I made a wrong turn somewhere and tried to leave but the door out was missing!"
"I moved further in since I couldn't just leave, you know, and I found Him. The caretaker of the Emporium. I couldnt make him out very well at first, he just stood in the shadows. I could see that he was a little man, might've been just old and crooked, but he looked at me and KNEW me. said my name and everything. When I asked how he knew, he replied if I was here to get my old bike back."
"What bike?" I say.
"An old metal bike you lost at the creek south of town. Purple and silver. Your father painted that for you, yes?"
My old man had put that bike together and painted it for me when I was wee. Only 7 years old, and I lost it when I was 7.5 years old. Some little (Expletive) decided to have some fun and threw my bike into the creek and the steep embankment made it impossible to get it out. I walked home from the creek, crying. My dad tore a strip off me for losing it.
(...)
Anyhoo, must've sat looking dumb cause next thing I seen was the old man holding my bike. Same amateur spraypaint job and cobbled together out of whatever pieces (my dad) got ahold of. 20 years later and I'm staring at the (expletive) thing like it wasn't rusting in a creek for two decades. "How'd you get that?" I say to him.
He says that he always finds the lost and broken things, and asks if I want it back.
And then he moved into the light.

His eyes. 
They were pearl-like, or it looked like it in the terrible lighting - hollow and empty, like that [Hunter](cryptids.md). Pale and milky and staring right through me.

He grins.
And his teeth are long and needle-like, looking like translucent cartilage. 

His voice hollow.
"Do you want it? Can you pay the price?"
And held it out.

I bolted towards where I came in not even caring if that creepy old (EXPLETIVE) was behind me or not. 
I found the door.

Still dont know what my old bike wouldve cost me, but my gut told me it was nothing good."
