# CRYPTIDS BIG AND SMALL

## The Hollow-Eyed Hunter
Folks, we've got a spooky one for you today. 

A creature has been reported stalking the woods of Bitterbrook, a being of terrifying appearance and eerie behaviour. Known as the Hollow-Eyed Hunter, due to its most striking feature - empty eye sockets that seem to stare into your very soul. Some say it's a ghostly remnant of a past tragedy, others claim it's a demonic entity bent on causing mischief and fear. Whatever the truth may be, one thing is for certain - the Hollow-Eyed Hunter is not something you want to run into on a dark night in Bitterbrook. 

Stay safe out there, friends.

## The Memento Emporium

Here's one to keep you up at night,
The Memento Emporium is a mausoleum of memories. Its walls are lined with mementos of lives long gone, each with its own silent tale to tell. The shopkeeper, a dark and enigmatic presence, roams the store, seeming to know the secrets of every item within. It's a place where the past refuses to stay buried, and the present is a mere reflection of the echoes of lives long since lived. For those brave enough to enter, be warned - you may never be the same again.

## Radio Marconi

A radio that can supposedly understand what's going on around it and can communicate using snippets of dialogue from braodcasts from any time after 1953. Marconi also supposedly can communicate in multiple languages with some stories claiming they heard French in both a Quebecois and Parisian accent.
