# CRYPTIDS BIG AND SMALL

## The Hollow-Eyed Hunter
Folks, we've got a spooky one for you today. 

A creature has been reported stalking the woods of Bitterbrook, a being of terrifying appearance and eerie behaviour. Known as the Hollow-Eyed Hunter, due to its most striking feature - empty eye sockets that seem to stare into your very soul. Some say it's a ghostly remnant of a past tragedy, others claim it's a demonic entity bent on causing mischief and fear. Whatever the truth may be, one thing is for certain - the Hollow-Eyed Hunter is not something you want to run into on a dark night in Bitterbrook. 

Stay safe out there, friends.

## The Memento Emporium

Here's one to keep you up at night,
The Memento Emporium is a mausoleum of memories. Its walls are lined with mementos of lives long gone, each with its own silent tale to tell. The shopkeeper, a dark and enigmatic presence, roams the store, seeming to know the secrets of every item within. It's a place where the past refuses to stay buried, and the present is a mere reflection of the echoes of lives long since lived. For those brave enough to enter, be warned - you may never be the same again.
