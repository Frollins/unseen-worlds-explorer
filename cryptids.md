## The Memento Emporium
Would you consider a building as a cryptid? I do.

The Memento Emporium is a transitory building within Bitterbrook. Word says that the Emporium will appear within abandoned buildings, like the abandoned Esso gas station located on Main Street.
Or on even rarer occasions, find the Emporium within already occupied buildings! *See (Countryside Market sighting) [local sightings.md]

Legend has it that the proprietor, a shadowy figure only seen in reflections, trades in memories and lost belongings. But be warned: the cost is high, and the items may hold more than just sentimental value. Some say the shop is a gateway to the supernatural, and those who have dealings with it are haunted by the repercussions. So, cryptid hunters, keep your eyes peeled and your skepticism on high alert. The Memento Emporium could be the clue we've been searching for.
