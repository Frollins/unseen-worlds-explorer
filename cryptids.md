## The Memento Emporium
Would you consider a building as a cryptid? I do.

The Memento Emporium is a transitory building within Bitterbrook. Word says that the Emporium will appear within abandoned buildings, like the abandoned Esso gas station located on Main Street.
Or on even rarer occasions, find the Emporium within already occupied buildings!

(REDACTED), a librarian tech at Bitterbrook Library and Repository, found herself walking into the Emporium after passing through the doors to the Archives located at the back of the building. (I must mention that this is all "alleged" and the source of this anecdote remains anonymous. But we know the truth, fellow cryptid chasers!)

The source claims that "After entering the archives, there was all these shelves. filled to the brim with knicks knacks and oddities. Thought I made a wrong turn somewhere and tried to leave but the door out was missing!"

"I moved further in since I couldn't just leave, you know, and I found Him. The caretaker of the Emporium. They was a little man, might've been just old and crooked, but he looked at me and KNEW me. said my name and everything. When I asked how he knew, he replied if I was hear to get my old bike back."

"What bike?"

"An old metal bike you lost at the creek south of town. Purple and silver. You father painted that for you, yes?"

My old man had out that bike together and painted it for me when I was wee. Only 7 years old, and I lost it when I was 7.5 years old. Some little (language redacted) decided to have some fun and threw my bike into the creek and the steep embankment made it impossible to get it out. I walked home from the creek, crying. My dad tore a strip off me for losing it.

Must've sat looking dumb cause next thing I seen was the old man holding my bike. same amateur paint job and cobbled together out of whatever pieces (my dad) got ahold of. 20 years later and I'm staring at the (language redacted) thing like it wasn't rusting in a creek for two decades. "How'd you get that?" I says to him.

He just smiled and says that he always finds the lost and broken things, and asks if I want it back.

his eyes. they were black, or it looked like it in the terrible lighting - hollow and empty, like that Hunter. 


It terrified me. So I ran.

Still dont know what my old bike wouldve cost me, but my gut told me it was nothing good."
